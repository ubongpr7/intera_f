Regarding the Kotlin POS System:

You mentioned that the POS system is created with Kotlin to handle offline-first capabilities. My analysis was limited to the Next.js codebase, so I cannot directly evaluate the Kotlin application. However, for the offline features to work, the Next.js backend would need to provide APIs for the Kotlin application to consume. These APIs would need to handle:

Data Synchronization: Endpoints for the POS to send offline transactions and receive inventory updates.
Authentication: Securely authenticating the POS system.
Conflict Resolution: Logic to handle potential conflicts when syncing offline data.
I did not see any explicit evidence of these specific APIs in the files I examined, but they could exist in the app/api directory or be under development.

Recommendations:

Focus on Offline Capabilities: The most significant gap in your current inventory management system is the lack of offline support. Since you have a Kotlin POS system, the next step is to build the necessary API endpoints in your Next.js application to enable data synchronization.
Hardware Integration: For features like barcode scanning, receipt printing, and cash drawer integration, you will need to build integrations with the specific hardware you plan to support. This will likely involve using third-party libraries or SDKs.
Expand Payment Options: To support cash, card, and mobile payments, you will need to integrate with additional payment gateways and build the necessary UI components in your POS system.
Enhance Reporting: While you have some basic reporting, you can enhance it by adding more detailed reports for payment types, sales trends, and profit margins.
This evaluation should give you a clear understanding of your current inventory management capabilities and the areas where you need to focus your development efforts.
